/**
 * Stable Marriage problem:
 * Given n men and n women, where each person has ranked all members
 * of the opposite sex with a unique number between 1 and n in order of preference,
 * marry the men and women together such that there are no two people of opposite sex
 * who would both rather have each other than their current partners.
 * If there are no such people, all the marriages are "stable".
