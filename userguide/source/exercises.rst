Exercises
******************************

We propose a set of exercises to extend mini-cp with useful features.
By doing these exercises you will gradually progress in your understanding of CP.
For each exercise, we ask you to implement JUnit tests to make sure that
your implementation works as expected.
If you don't test each feature independently you take the risk to
loose a lot of time finding very difficult bugs.


Learning Outcomes
=======================================

Be able to

* Understand reversible data structures
* Understand a domain
* Implement global constraints
* Implement custom search
* Model CP easy problems
* Use LNS
* Write unit-tests for constraints and models
* Debug constraints, models, etc




Implement the less or equal reified constraint
=================================


The file is ``*``
Check that your implementation pass the tests.



AllDifferent Forward Checking
=================================

Implement a dedicated algorithm for the all-different.
Whenever a variable is bound to a value, this value is removed from the domain of other variables.


Conflict based search branching
=================================================================



Implement a binary first fail search strategy.
You can use the ``branch`` helper method to create the array of alternatives.
You should select the unbound variable with minimum domain first.
On the left this variable is assigned to the value given by the heuristic.
On the right this same value is removed.
Capture a call to ``Store::add(new EqualVal(x,v))`` on the left branch,
and ``Store::add(new DifferentVal(x,v))`` on the right branch.

Discrepancy Search
=================================================================

Implement ``DiscrepancyBranching``, a branching that can wrap any branching
to limit the discrepancy of the branching.

Depth First Search
=================================================================

Replace the recursive DFS search by a non recursive implementation using an explicit stack.
